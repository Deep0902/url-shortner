# Request for Code Review

- Show only the lines of code that need to be changed, added, or modified, instead of displaying the entire code block with the changes. This will help in focusing on the specific updates and make the review process more efficient.
- Give me a short  summary of the changes made, focusing on the key aspects that were modified or added.
- Show the files that were changed, added, or deleted, and provide a small description of each file's purpose.
